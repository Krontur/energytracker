# Energy Tracker

The purpose of this project is to develop a web application for querying and analysing the 15-minute load profiles of
electric meters at Leipzig Airport. This project arises from the airport's need to modernize its energy management system,
which faces limitations in data collection and analysis due to outdated technologies and a lack of suitable tools.

The methodology employed includes the design and implementation of new software that communicates with summation stations 
via Ethernet connections and RS232 ports, utilizing specific protocols such as the Energy Control Language (ECL).

The backend is developed using Java and Spring Boot, while the frontend is built with React.js and Material-UI, 
ensuring a robust and scalable architecture. A PostgreSQL database is implemented to store load profiles, incorporating 
validation and data correction algorithms to ensure data integrity. As a result, an intuitive and functional web 
application is created, enabling energy managers at the airport to efficiently visualize and analyse electricity consumption.

The developed API facilitates data access and integration with other systems. This solution significantly improves the 
quality and reliability of information, allowing for the identification of consumption patterns, detection of inefficiencies, 
and informed decision-making to optimize energy efficiency.

In conclusion, the project contributes to the enhancement of 
energy management at Leipzig Airport, aligning with international standards of the ISO 50001. The developed application 
not only addresses the limitations of the previous system but also establishes a solid foundation for future improvements 
and expansions, promoting sustainability and operational efficiency at the airport.
