# ‚öôÔ∏è Energy Tracker ‚Äì Backend

**Energy Tracker** is the backend of a complete energy data management platform developed as the **Final Degree Project (TFG)** of **√ìscar Gonz√°lez Tur** (BSc. in Computer Engineering).  
The system was designed for **Leipzig Airport**, addressing the need to modernize its energy monitoring infrastructure and enable efficient, reliable, and sustainable energy management.

---

## üåç Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to develop a **web application and RESTful API** for querying and analysing the 15-minute load profiles of electric meters at Leipzig Airport.  
This solution improves data quality, facilitates detailed analysis, and helps energy managers identify consumption patterns, inefficiencies, and opportunities for optimization ‚Äî in full alignment with **ISO 50001** standards.

The backend was developed with **Java and Spring Boot**, while the frontend was built with **React.js and Material-UI**, ensuring a **robust, scalable, and modular architecture**.  
A **PostgreSQL** database stores validated load profiles, ensuring integrity and reliability through automatic validation and correction mechanisms.

## üß† Architecture

The platform is built on a **microservice architecture** with a **Hexagonal (Ports and Adapters) design**, promoting independence between the business logic and external interfaces.

### üîß Main Microservices
- **AuthService** ‚Üí Authentication and role-based access using JWT.
- **UserService** ‚Üí User management and role assignment.
- **DeviceCatalog** ‚Üí Registration and configuration of energy meters, stations, and metering points.
- **DataCollector** ‚Üí Real-time data collection via Ethernet/RS232 using the proprietary **ECL (Energy Control Language)** protocol.
- **ConsumptionService** ‚Üí Storage, analysis, and CSV export of consumption data.
- **RabbitMQ** ‚Üí Asynchronous messaging for decoupled service communication.
